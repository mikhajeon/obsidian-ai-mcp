This is the most important step - connecting Claude Desktop to your Obsidian vault.

#### Windows

1. Open File Explorer and navigate to:
   ```
   %APPDATA%\Claude\
   ```
   (Paste this in the address bar)

2. Open or create `claude_desktop_config.json`

3. Add this configuration (replace `YOUR_VAULT_PATH`):
   ```json
   {
     "mcpServers": {
       "obsidian": {
         "command": "node",
         "args": ["C:/Users/YourUser/path/to/vault/.obsidian/plugins/obsidian-ai-mcp/mcp-client.js"]
       }
     }
   }
   ```

   **Example:**
   ```json
   {
     "mcpServers": {
       "obsidian": {
         "command": "node",
         "args": ["C:/Users/John/Documents/MyVault/.obsidian/plugins/obsidian-ai-mcp/mcp-client.js"]
       }
     }
   }
   ```

   ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important:** Use forward slashes (`/`) not backslashes (`\`) in the path!

#### macOS

1. Open Terminal

2. Edit the config file:
   ```bash
   nano ~/Library/Application\ Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json
   ```

3. Add this configuration (replace path):
   ```json
   {
     "mcpServers": {
       "obsidian": {
         "command": "node",
         "args": ["/Users/yourname/path/to/vault/.obsidian/plugins/obsidian-ai-mcp/mcp-client.js"]
       }
     }
   }
   ```

4. Save with `Ctrl+O`, `Enter`, then exit with `Ctrl+X`

#### Linux

1. Open Terminal

2. Edit the config file:
   ```bash
   nano ~/.config/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json
   ```

3. Add this configuration (replace path):
   ```json
   {
     "mcpServers": {
       "obsidian": {
         "command": "node",
         "args": ["/home/yourname/path/to/vault/.obsidian/plugins/obsidian-ai-mcp/mcp-client.js"]
       }
     }
   }
   ```

4. Save with `Ctrl+O`, `Enter`, then exit with `Ctrl+X`

### Step 4: Start the MCP Server

#### Method 1: Auto-start (Recommended)

If you enabled "Enable MCP Server" in settings, the server starts automatically when Obsidian loads.

Just **restart Obsidian** now.

#### Method 2: Manual start

1. Open Obsidian

2. Press `Ctrl+P` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+P` (macOS) to open Command Palette

3. Type: `Start MCP Server`

4. Press Enter

You should see a notice: "MCP Server started successfully"

### Step 5: Connect Claude Desktop

1. **Completely quit** Claude Desktop (not just close the window - quit from system tray/menu bar)

2. **Restart** Claude Desktop

3. Open a new chat in Claude

4. Look for the üî® tools icon or mention of "obsidian" in Claude's available tools

### Step 6: Test the Connection

Ask Claude something like:

```
Can you list all the notes in my Obsidian vault?
```

or

```
Please read my note called "Daily Notes/2025-10-02"
```

If Claude can respond with your notes, **congratulations! You're all set! üéâ**

## Verification Checklist

Use this checklist to verify everything is working:

- [ ] Plugin appears in Obsidian's Community Plugins list
- [ ] Plugin is toggled ON
- [ ] MCP Server shows as "Running" in Command Palette ‚Üí "MCP Server Status"
- [ ] `claude_desktop_config.json` has correct path with forward slashes
- [ ] Claude Desktop was fully restarted after config change
- [ ] Claude shows tools/connection to Obsidian in new chat
- [ ] Claude can successfully list or read notes

## Troubleshooting

### "MCP Server failed to start"

**Cause:** Port 3010 might be in use

**Solution:**
1. Check what's using port 3010:
   ```bash
   # Windows
   netstat -ano | findstr :3010

   # macOS/Linux
   lsof -i :3010
   ```

2. Either:
   - Kill that process: `npx kill-port 3010`
   - Change the port in plugin settings

### "Claude doesn't see the Obsidian connection"

**Causes & Solutions:**

1. **Wrong path in config**
   - Double-check the path to `mcp-client.js`
   - Make sure you're using forward slashes (`/`)
   - Path should be absolute, not relative

2. **Claude Desktop not fully restarted**
   - Quit Claude from system tray/menu bar
   - Wait 5 seconds
   - Open Claude Desktop again

3. **MCP Server not running**
   - In Obsidian, run: Command Palette ‚Üí "MCP Server Status"
   - Should say "Running"
   - If not, run "Start MCP Server"

4. **Node.js not in PATH**
   - Test in terminal: `node --version`
   - If error, reinstall Node.js and check "Add to PATH" option

### "Permission denied" or "Cannot read file"

**Solution:**
Enable the required permissions in plugin settings:
- Enable Search
- Enable Write
- Enable Read (should be on by default)

### Plugin won't load after restart

**Solution:**
1. Check Obsidian console for errors:
   - View ‚Üí Toggle Developer Tools
   - Look at Console tab for red errors

2. Rebuild the plugin:
   ```bash
   cd /path/to/vault/.obsidian/plugins/obsidian-ai-mcp
   npm run build
   ```

3. Restart Obsidian
