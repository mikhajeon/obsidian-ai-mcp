**AI MCP** enables AI applications like Claude Desktop to securely access and work with your vault through the Model Context Protocol (MCP). MCP is an open protocol that standardizes how AI applications can interact with external data sources and tools while maintaining security and user control.[^1]

This plugin creates a local WebSocket-based MCP server, acting as a secure bridge between your vault and AI applications like Claude Desktop. This means AI assistants can read your notes, create new content, search your vault, and manage files - but only when you allow it and only through the server's controlled API. The server never gives AI applications direct filesystem access to your vault.[^2]

**Privacy Note:** When using Claude Desktop with this plugin, your conversations with Claude are not used to train Anthropic's models by default.[^3]

## Features

When connected to an MCP client like Claude Desktop, this plugin enables:

- **üìñ Vault Access**: Read and reference your notes while maintaining your vault's security[^4]
- **‚úçÔ∏è Content Creation**: Create and update notes through AI interactions
- **üóëÔ∏è File Management**: Delete notes with configurable permissions
- **üîç Semantic Search**: Search your vault based on content and context
- **üìã List Operations**: Browse and discover all notes in your vault
- **‚öôÔ∏è Configurable Permissions**: Control exactly what operations AI can perform

All features require an MCP-compatible client like Claude Desktop, as this plugin provides the server component that enables these integrations. The plugin does not modify Obsidian's functionality directly - instead, it creates a secure bridge that allows AI applications to work with your vault in powerful ways.

## Prerequisites

- v0.15.0 or higher (Desktop only)
- **Claude Desktop** installed and configured ([Download here](https://claude.ai/download))

> **‚ö†Ô∏è Platform Note:** This plugin has been primarily tested on **Windows**. While it should work on macOS and Linux, some features may require additional testing or configuration on those platforms.

## Installation

### From Community Plugins (Recommended)

1. Open **Settings**
2. Go to **Community plugins** ‚Üí **Browse**
3. Search for **"AI MCP"**
4. Click **Install**
5. Once installed, click **Enable**

### Configure Plugin Settings

1. In Settings, find **AI MCP** in the left sidebar
2. Configure your preferences:

   | Setting | Description | Recommended |
   |---------|-------------|-------------|
   | **Auto-start MCP Server** | Automatically start server when Obsidian launches | ‚úÖ Enable for convenience |
   | **Enable Write Operations** | Allow Claude to create/update notes | ‚úÖ Enable |
   | **Enable Delete Operations** | Allow Claude to delete notes | ‚ö†Ô∏è Enable with caution |

   > **Note:** Read operations (including search and metadata access) are always enabled as they are core to vault interaction.

3. Click outside settings to save

### Configure Claude Desktop (Required)

This step is **essential** for the plugin to work with Claude Desktop.

#### Locate Claude Desktop Config File

- **Windows**: `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`
- **macOS**: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
- **Linux**: `~/.config/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`

#### Add MCP Server Configuration

Open `claude_desktop_config.json` and add this configuration:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "obsidian": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/absolute/path/to/vault/.obsidian/plugins/obsidian-ai-mcp/mcp-client.js"]
    }
  }
}
```

> **‚ö†Ô∏è Critical:**
> - Use **absolute paths** (not relative)
> - Windows users must use **forward slashes** (`/`) not backslashes (`\`)
> - Replace `/absolute/path/to/vault` with your actual vault path

> **üìù Note:** Replace `Username` with your actual system username and `MyVault` with your actual vault name in all examples below. 

**Example for Windows:**
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "obsidian": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["C:/Users/Username/Documents/MyVault/.obsidian/plugins/obsidian-ai-mcp/mcp-client.js"]
    }
  }
}
```

**Example for macOS:**
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "obsidian": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/Users/Username/Documents/MyVault/.obsidian/plugins/obsidian-ai-mcp/mcp-client.js"]
    }
  }
}
```

**Example for Linux:**
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "obsidian": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/home/Username/Documents/MyVault/.obsidian/plugins/obsidian-ai-mcp/mcp-client.js"]
    }
  }
}
```

### Start the MCP Server

**Option A - Auto-start (Recommended):**
1. Ensure "Auto-start MCP Server" is toggled ON in plugin settings
2. Restart Obsidian
3. Server starts automatically on launch
4. If it doesn't start for some reason, use Command Palette ‚Üí "Start MCP Server"

### Connect Claude Desktop

1. **Completely quit** Claude Desktop (exit from system tray/menu bar, not just close window)
2. **Restart** Claude Desktop
3. Open a new chat
4. Look for the üî® tools icon or "obsidian" in available tools

### Test the Connection

Ask Claude:
```
Can you list all the notes in my Obsidian vault?
```

or

```
Please read my note called "your note name"
```

If Claude responds with your vault content, **congratulations! You're all set! üéâ**


## Usage

Once connected, Claude Desktop can interact with your vault using natural language.

### Example Commands

- "Read the note called 'Project Ideas'"
- "Create a new note called 'Meeting Notes' with today's agenda"
- "Search my vault for notes about 'machine learning'"
- "Update my Daily Note to add a new task: review pull requests"
- "List all notes in my Projects folder"
- "Delete the note 'Scratch Pad'"

### Available MCP Tools

Claude has access to these tools:

| Tool | Description | Parameters | Permission Required |
|------|-------------|------------|---------------------|
| `read_note` | Read content of a note | `path`: Note path | Read (always enabled) |
| `write_note` | Create a new note | `path`: Note path<br>`content`: Note content | Write |
| `update_note` | Update existing note | `path`: Note path<br>`content`: New content | Write |
| `delete_note` | Delete a note | `path`: Note path | Delete |
| `list_notes` | List all notes in vault | None | Read (always enabled) |
| `search_vault` | Search vault content | `query`: Search term | Search |

### Plugin Commands

Access these through Command Palette (`Ctrl/Cmd + P`):

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `Start MCP Server` | Manually start the MCP server |
| `Stop MCP Server` | Stop the running MCP server |
| `MCP Server Status` | Check if server is running |

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

### ‚ùå MCP Server Won't Start

**Issue:** Error message when starting server or server status shows "Stopped"

**Solutions:**

1. **Check if port 3010 is already in use:**
   ```bash
   # Windows
   netstat -ano | findstr :3010

   # macOS/Linux
   lsof -i :3010
   ```

2. **Kill the process using the port:**
   ```bash
   npx kill-port 3010
   ```

3. **Check Obsidian console for errors:**
   - View ‚Üí Toggle Developer Tools ‚Üí Console tab
   - Look for red error messages

### ‚ùå Claude Desktop Doesn't See Obsidian Connection

**Issue:** Claude doesn't show Obsidian tools or connection

**Solutions:**

1. **Verify config file path is correct:**
   - Open `claude_desktop_config.json`
   - Confirm the path to `mcp-client.js` is absolute and correct
   - Test the path exists: `ls /path/to/mcp-client.js` (should not error)

2. **Use forward slashes in paths (Windows):**
   ```json
   ‚úÖ "C:/Users/Username/Vault/.obsidian/plugins/obsidian-ai-mcp/mcp-client.js"
   ‚ùå "C:\Users\Username\Vault\.obsidian\plugins\obsidian-ai-mcp\mcp-client.js"
   ```

3. **Fully restart Claude Desktop:**
   - **Windows**: Right-click system tray icon ‚Üí Quit
   - **macOS**: Claude menu ‚Üí Quit Claude
   - **Linux**: Close window and ensure process is killed
   - Wait 5 seconds, then reopen

4. **Verify MCP server is running:**
   - In Obsidian: Command Palette ‚Üí "MCP Server Status"
   - Should say "Running"
   - If not, run "Start MCP Server"

5. **Test Node.js is available:**
   ```bash
   node --version
   ```
   - Should show v16.0 or higher
   - If error, reinstall Node.js and ensure it's in PATH

### ‚ùå Tools Not Working

**Issue:** Claude sees Obsidian connection but tools fail or error

**Solutions:**

1. **Enable required permissions:**
   - Obsidian Settings ‚Üí AI MCP
   - Toggle ON: Enable Write Operations, Enable Delete Operations (if needed)

2. **Check file paths in Claude requests:**
   - Paths should be relative to vault root
   - Use forward slashes: `folder/note.md`
   - Don't include `.obsidian` in paths

3. **View detailed error logs:**
   - Obsidian: View ‚Üí Toggle Developer Tools ‚Üí Console
   - Look for errors when Claude tries to use tools

4. **Verify vault service is working:**
   - Try reading a known note through Claude
   - If that fails, check file permissions on vault folder

### üí° Common Issues

| Symptom | Likely Cause | Solution |
|---------|--------------|----------|
| "Connection refused" | MCP server not running | Start server in Obsidian |
| "ECONNRESET" | Port already in use | Change port or kill process |
| "Path not found" | Wrong path in config | Fix `claude_desktop_config.json` |
| Claude shows no tools | Config not loaded | Fully restart Claude Desktop |
| "Permission denied" | Permissions disabled | Enable in plugin settings |

## Security

### Path Validation

- All file operations validate paths to prevent directory traversal attacks
- Paths are normalized and checked against vault root
- Attempts to access files outside vault are blocked

### Configurable Permissions

Control exactly what AI assistants can do:

- **Read**: Always enabled (includes search and metadata access)
- **Write**: Toggle to control note creation and modification
- **Delete**: Toggle to control note deletion (disabled by default)

### Local-Only Communication

- MCP server runs locally on your machine
- WebSocket connection is local (127.0.0.1)
- No data is sent to external servers by this plugin
- Only Claude Desktop (with your explicit configuration) can connect
